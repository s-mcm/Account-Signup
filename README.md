CMP1902M – Programming Fundamentals – Assessment 1

Command line program. Simulates a user creating an account and recieveing an email address.

Task 3 includes a guessing number minigame.

# How it works
* User enters their desired name, age, and password
* Program greets the user
* Only ages 11-18 are allowed
* Only "strong" passwords with length 12 are allowed
* Generates a new email address based on their full name, birth year and a randomly generated number between 10 – 99

Task 3:
* You, the user, will have in your head a number
* The user to set a range to help the computer
* For example, if you have number 49 in your mind, you will set the range to be 1 to 100
* The program will guess a number within the ranges
* The user will say whether it is too high, too low, or your number
* Number of attempted guesses are displayed
* Optimal guessing strategy is used

# Concepts
* Appropriate program structure
* Black box testing
* Input validation
* Good programming practices
